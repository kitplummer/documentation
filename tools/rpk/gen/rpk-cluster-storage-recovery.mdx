title: rpk cluster storage recovery
rpk_version: v23.2.1

Interact with the topic recovery process.
This command is used to restore topics from the archival bucket, which can be
useful for disaster recovery or if a topic was accidentally deleted.

To begin the recovery process, use the "recovery start" command. Note that this
process can take a while to complete, so the command will exit after starting
it. If you want the command to wait for the process to finish, use the "--wait"
or "-w" flag.

You can check the status of the recovery process with the "recovery status"
command after it has been started.

## Usage

```bash
rpk cluster storage recovery [flags]
  rpk cluster storage recovery [command]
```
