Queries cluster for partition balancer status:

If continuous partition balancing is enabled, redpanda will continuously
reassign partitions from both unavailable nodes and from nodes using more disk
space than the configured limit.

This command can be used to monitor the partition balancer status.

    </tr>

### Stalled Balancer

A stalled balancer can occur for a few reasons and requires a bit of manual
investigation. A few areas to investigate:

- Are there are enough healthy nodes to which to move partitions? For example,
  in a three node cluster, no movements are possible for partitions with three
  replicas. You will see a stall every time there is a violation.

- Does the cluster have sufficient space? If all nodes in the cluster are
  utilizing more than 80% of their disk space, rebalancing cannot proceed.

- Do all partitions have quorum? If the majority of a partition's replicas are
  down, the partition cannot be moved.

- Are any nodes in maintenance mode? Partitions are not moved if any node is in
  maintenance mode.

## Usage

```bash
rpk cluster partitions balancer-status [flags]
```
