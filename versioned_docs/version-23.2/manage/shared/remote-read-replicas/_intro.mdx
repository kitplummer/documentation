A Remote Read Replica topic is a read-only topic that mirrors a topic on a different cluster. Remote Read Replicas work with both [Tiered Storage](../tiered-storage/) and [archival storage](../data-archiving).

When a topic has object storage enabled, you can create a separate remote cluster just for consumers of this topic, and populate its topics from object storage. A read-only topic on a remote cluster can serve any consumer, without increasing the load on the origin cluster. Use cases for Remote Read Replicas include data analytics, offline model training, and development clusters.

You can create Remote Read Replica topics in a Redpanda cluster that directly accesses data in object storage. Because these read-only topics access data directly from object storage instead of the topics' origin cluster, there's no impact to the performance of the cluster. Topic data can be consumed within a region of your choice, regardless of the region where it was produced. 

:::info
- The Remote Read Replica cluster must run on the same version of Redpanda as the origin cluster, or just one feature release ahead of the origin cluster. For example, if the origin cluster is version 23.1, the Remote Read Replica cluster can be 23.2, but not 23.4. It cannot skip feature releases.
- When upgrading, upgrade the Remote Read Replica cluster before upgrading the origin cluster. 
- When upgrading to Redpanda 23.2, metadata from object storage is not synchronized until all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If you need to force a mixed-version cluster to sync read replicas, move partition leadership to brokers running the original version.
