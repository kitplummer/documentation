title: rpk group offset-delete
rpk_version: v23.2.1
---

Forcefully delete offsets for a kafka group.

The broker will only allow the request to succeed if the group is in a dead
state (no subscriptions) or there are no subscriptions for offsets for
topic/partitions requested to be deleted.

Use either the --from-file or the --topic option. They are mututally exclusive.
To indicate which topics or topic partitions you'd like to remove offsets from use
the --topic (-t) flag, followed by a comma separated list of partition ids. Supplying
no list will delete all offsets for all partitions for a given topic.

You may also provide a text file to indicate topic/partition tuples. Use the
--from-file flag for this option. The file must contain lines of topic/partitions
separated by a tab or space. Example:

topic_a 0
topic_a 1
topic_b 0

## Usage

```bash
rpk group offset-delete [GROUP] --from-file FILE --topic foo:0,1,2 [flags]
```
