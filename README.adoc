This branch contains the content for the home page of the Redpanda documentation.

The home page is hosted in the {url-docs}/tree/home[`home` branch] and is configured as a dedicated component called `home` so that we can host it at the root of the site under the `/home` path.

The link:./antora.yml[`antora.yml`] file contains the content for the home page. This content is read by a template in the UI to produce the home page. The template for the home page is in the {url-ui}/blob/main/src/partials/home.hbs[`home.hbs`] file of the link:{url-ui}[`docs-ui` repository].
