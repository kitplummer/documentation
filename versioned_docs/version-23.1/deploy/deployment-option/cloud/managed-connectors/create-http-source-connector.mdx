You can use an HTTP Source connector to enable change data capture (CDC) from
JSON/HTTP APIs into Redpanda. The HTTP Source connector imports data from HTTP
services as batches or increments.

## Prerequisites

- A request URL that is accessible by the connector
- A user/password created in source so that the connector can authenticate

## Limitations

Only `JSON` or `AVRO` formats can be used as a value converter.

## Create an HTTP Source connector

To create the HTTP Source connector:

1. In Redpanda Cloud, click **Connectors** in the navigation menu, and then
   click **Create Connector**.
2. Select **Import from HTTP**.
3. On the **Create Connector** page, specify the following required connector
   configuration options:

   | Property                             | Description |
   | ------------------------------------ | ----------- |
   | `Topic` | Name of the topic where the record will be sent. |
   | `HTTP URL` | HTTP URL to use in the request. |
   | `HTTP request params` | HTTP query parameters to use in the request. Use `&` separated list = separated pairs. For example, `name=value&name2=value2`. |
   | `Authentication type` | Type of authentication. If using `Basic`, provide `User` and `Password`. Default is None. |
   | `Kafka message key format`  | Format of the key in the Kafka topic. Default is `JSON`. If choosing `AVRO`, specify the `Kafka message value format`.|
   | `Message key JSON contains schema` | Specifies whether or not the message key contains schema in the schema field. |
   | `Max Tasks`  | Maximum number of tasks to use for this connector. The default is `1`. Each task replicates an exclusive set of partitions assigned to it. |
   | `Connector name` | Globally-unique name to use for this connector. |
4. Click **Next**. Review the connector properties specified, then click **Create**.

## Map data

Use `JSON` or `AVRO` converters to map data from an HTTP endpoint to a Redpanda
topic.

## Test the connection

After the connector is created:

- Check the connector status and confirm that there are no errors in logs and in Redpanda Console.
- Review the Redpanda topic to confirm that it contains the expected data.

## Troubleshoot

Most HTTP Source connector issues are reported as a failed task. An invalid connection
URL is reported in logs.

Additional errors and corrective actions follow.

| Message | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **RetriableException: java.net.UnknownHostException: invalid-url.com.pl: Name or service not known / RetriableException: java.net.SocketTimeoutException: Connect timed out** | Verify that the HTTP URL is correct, the hostname and port are correct, and that the service accepts connections. |
| **IllegalStateException: Policy failed for response code: 403** | Confirm that the service URL accepts requests from the connector, with HTTP code 200. |
| **IllegalArgumentException: No node at '/items' (unmatched part: '/items')** | Confirm that `HTTP response list pointer` is a valid pointer in the HTTP result document. |
| **IllegalArgumentException: No node at '/invalid-key' (unmatched part: '/invalid-key')** | Confirm that the `HTTP response record offset pointer` defines valid elements of the HTTP result document. |
