To create a Redpanda cluster in your virtual private cloud (VPC), log in to the Redpanda Cloud UI
and create a namespace, then follow the steps to create a Bring Your Own Cloud
(BYOC) cluster.

## Create a namespace

<CreateNamespace/>

## Create a BYOC cluster

1. On the Home page, select your namespace (namespaces are listed in alphabetical order), and click **Create cluster**.
2. Click **Create BYOC cluster**.

   Enter a cluster name, and select the provider (AWS), region, availability zone type (single AZ or multi AZ) and zones, throughput tier, and Redpanda version. 
   
   :::note notes
   - If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
   - Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
   :::

3.  Click **Next**.
   
4.  On the Network page, enter the connection type: either **Public** or **Private**. For BYOC clusters, **Private** is best-practice. 

    - Your network name is used in the Redpanda UI to identify this network. 
    - For a CIDR range, choose one that does not overlap with your existing VPCs or your Redpanda network.
5.  Click **Next**.
6.  On the Deploy page, you need to prepare your environment, then run the `rpk plugin install` command in your environment.

   As part of agent deployment, Redpanda assigns the permission required to run the agent. For details about these permissions, see [AWS IAM policies](../security/authorization/cloud-iam-policies#aws-iam-policies).
