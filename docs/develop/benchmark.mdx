Learn how to measure the performance of a Redpanda cluster deployed on AWS EC2 instances with the Linux Foundation's OpenMessaging Benchmark. Run the same tests and workloads that Redpanda uses to demonstrate significantly better performance than Apache Kafka. 

## About OpenMessaging Benchmark

The [Linux Foundation's OpenMessaging Benchmark](https://openmessaging.cloud/docs/benchmarks/) (OMB) Framework is an open-source, cloud-based benchmark framework that supports several messaging systems, including Kafka, and is configurable for workloads representing real-world use cases.

Redpanda Data provides a [fork of OMB on Github](https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark) with some updates:
- Fixed coalescing of asynchronous consumer offset requests in the OMB Kafka driver.
- Support for Kafka 3.2.0 clients. 

### OMB workloads

An OMB workload is a benchmark configuration that sets the producers, consumers, topics, and messages used by a test, as well as the production rate and duration of each test. An OMB workload is specified in a YAML configuration file.

<details>
<summary>Example workload configuration file</summary>

The content of an OMB workload configuration file, copied from Redpanda Data's [fork of OMB](https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark/blob/main/workloads/1-topic-1-partition-1kb.yaml):

```
name: 1 topic / 1 partition / 1Kb

topics: 1
partitionsPerTopic: 1
keyDistributor: "NO_KEY"
messageSize: 1024
payloadFile: "payload/payload-1Kb.data"
subscriptionsPerTopic: 1
consumerPerSubscription: 1
producersPerTopic: 1
producerRate: 50000
consumerBacklogSizeGB: 0
testDurationMinutes: 15
```

The `keyDistributor` property configures how keys are distributed and assigned to messages.
- `NO_KEY` sets `null` for all keys.
- `KEY_ROUND_ROBIN` cycles through a finite set of keys in round-robin fashion.
- `RANDOM_NANO` returns random keys based on `System.nanoTime()`.

</details>

## Set up benchmark

Running OMB with Redpanda requires setting up your local environment to provision and start a Redpanda cluster in AWS.

1. Install CLI tools.
    - [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/install.html)
    - [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) with [terraform-inventory plugin](https://github.com/adammck/terraform-inventory)
    - [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html) (v2.11 or higher)
    - Python 3 and pip
    - A window manager like [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) or [screen](https://linux.die.net/man/1/screen) that supports detachable screen sessions.   

    :::tip
    Redpanda Data recommends running the benchmark executable with a window manager that supports detachable screen sessions, like tmux or screen, so the benchmark can continue to run in the background even after you disconnect. 
    :::

1. Clone the Redpanda Data fork of OMB.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/redpanda-data/openmessaging-benchmark 
    ```

    The repository contains a directory for the Redpanda driver, `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda`. Subsequent steps read and configure files in that directory.

1. Customize the `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/pom.xml` file with your Kafka client version if necessary (currently 3.3.1):

    ```xml title="pom.xml" {className='not-editable'}
    ...
    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.apache.kafka</groupId>
        <artifactId>kafka-clients</artifactId>
        <version>3.3.1</version>
    </dependency>
    ...
    ```

1. From the repository root directory, build the benchmark client.

    ```bash
    cd openmessaging-benchmark
    mvn clean install -Dlicense.skip=true
    ```

1. From the Redpanda driver directory, install the Ansible roles required for deploying Redpanda.

    ```bash
    cd driver-redpanda/deploy
    ansible-galaxy install -r driver-redpanda/deploy/requirements.yaml
    ```

1. Configure AWS credentials and SSH keys.

    1. [Install](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and [configure](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) AWS CLI.

    1. Generate SSH keys:

        ```bash
        ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws
        ```

        When prompted for a passphrase, set a blank passphrase by pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> twice.

    1. Verify the SSH key files were created.

        ```bash
        ls ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws*
        ```

1. Provision a Redpanda cluster to deploy on AWS with Terraform.

    1. Customize the `openmessaging-benchmark/deploy/terraform.tfvars` Terraform configuration file for your environment.

       <details>

        <summary>Default Terraform configuration for Redpanda on AWS</summary>

         The default contents of `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/deploy/terraform.tfvars`:

         ```text title="terraform.tfvars"
         public_key_path = "~/.ssh/redpanda_aws.pub"
         region          = "us-west-2"
         az		        = "us-west-2a"
         ami             = "ami-0d31d7c9fc9503726"
         profile         = "default"

         instance_types = {
         "redpanda"      = "i3en.6xlarge"
         "client"        = "m5n.8xlarge"
         "prometheus"    = "c5.2xlarge"
         }

         num_instances = {
         "client"     = 4
         "redpanda"   = 3
         "prometheus" = 1
         }
         ```

       </details>

    1. From the Redpanda driver deployment directory, initialize the Terraform deployment of Redpanda on AWS.

        ```bash
        cd driver-redpanda/deploy
        terraform init
        terraform apply -auto-approve
        ```

        :::note
        The `terraform apply` command prompts you for an owner name (`var.owner`) that is used to tag all the cloud resources that will be created. Once the installation is complete, you will see a confirmation message listing the resources that have been installed.
        :::

1. Run the Ansible playbook to install and start the Redpanda cluster.

    Redpanda can run with or without TLS and SASL enabled.
    
    - To run Redpanda **without TLS and SASL**:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook deploy.yaml
        ```

    - To run Redpanda **with TLS and SASL**:

        ```bash
        ansible-playbook deploy.yaml -e "tls_enabled=true sasl_enabled=true"
        ```

    If the path to your SSH private key isn't `~/.ssh/redpanda_aws`, add the `--private-key` flag to your Ansible command.

    ```bash
    ansible-playbook deploy.yaml --private-key=<private-key-path>
    ```

    :::note
    Beginning with Ansible 2.14, references to `args: warn` within Ansible tasks cause a fatal error and halt the execution of the playbook. You may find instances of this in the components installed by `ansible-galaxy`, particularly in the `cloudalchemy.grafana` task in `dashboards.yml`. To resolve this issue, removing the `warn` line in from the yml file.
    :::

## Run benchmark

Connect to the benchmark's client and run the benchmark with a custom workload. 

1. Connect with SSH to the benchmark client, with its IP address retrieved from the `client_ssh_host` output of Terraform.

    ```bash
    ssh -i ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws ubuntu@$(terraform output --raw client_ssh_host)
    ```

1. On the client, navigate to the `/opt/benchmark` directory.

    ```bash
    cd /opt/benchmark
    ```          

1. Create a workload configuration file. For example, create a `.yaml` file with one topic, 144 partitions, 500 MBps producer rate, four producers, and and four consumers:

    ```text
    cat > workloads/1-topic-144-partitions-500mb-4p-4c.yaml << EOF
    name: 500mb/sec rate; 4 producers 4 consumers; 1 topic with 144 partitions

    topics: 1
    partitionsPerTopic: 144

    messageSize: 1024
    useRandomizedPayloads: true
    randomBytesRatio: 0.5
    randomizedPayloadPoolSize: 1000

    subscriptionsPerTopic: 1
    consumerPerSubscription: 4
    producersPerTopic: 4

    producerRate: 500000

    consumerBacklogSizeGB: 0
    testDurationMinutes: 30
    EOF
    ```

    Alternatively, you can use an existing workload file from the Redpanda repo, in `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/deploy/workloads/`. 

   <details>
   <summary>Workloads from Redpanda vs. Kafka comparison</summary>

   The workloads from the [Redpanda vs. Kafka benchmark comparison](https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-vs-kafka-performance-benchmark) can be gotten from the chart in the comparison:

   ![](https://images.ctfassets.net/paqvtpyf8rwu/2lpkGM01nrl0s87xSBISno/6c25504b1f6e7c8015ef193433bd077e/kafka_vs_redpanda_performance_8.png)
   
   </details>

1. Create or reuse a client configuration file. This file configures the Redpanda producer and consumer clients, as well as topics. 

   The rest of the guide uses the `openmessaging-benchmark/driver-redpanda/redpanda-ack-all-group-linger-1ms.yaml` configuration file.

   <details>
   <summary>Client configuration from Redpanda vs. Kafka comparison</summary>

   The client configuration from the [Redpanda vs. Kafka benchmark comparison](https://redpanda.com/blog/redpanda-vs-kafka-performance-benchmark) can be gotten from the code listing in the comparison:

    ```yaml
    topicConfig: |
        min.insync.replicas=2
        flush.messages=1
        flush.ms=0
    producerConfig: |
        acks=all
        linger.ms=1
        batch.size=131072
    consumerConfig: |
        auto.offset.reset=earliest
        enable.auto.commit=false
        auto.commit.interval.ms=0
        max.partition.fetch.bytes=131072
    ```
   </details>

   :::tip
    Configure `reset=false` and manually delete the generated topic after the benchmark completes. Otherwise, when `reset=true`, the benchmark can fail due to it erroneously trying to delete the `_schemas` topic.
   :::

1. Run the benchmark with your workload and client configuration.

    ```bash
    sudo bin/benchmark -d \
    driver-redpanda/redpanda-ack-all-group-linger-1ms.yaml \ 
    workloads/1-topic-144-partitions-500mb-4p-4c.yaml
    ```

## View benchmark results

After a run completes, the benchmark generates results as `*.json` files in `/opt/benchmark`.

Redpanda provides a Python script, `generate_charts.py`, to generate charts of benchmark results. To run the script:

1. Copy the results from the client to your local machine.

    ```bash
    exit; # back to your local machine
    mkdir ~/results
    scp -i ~/.ssh/redpanda_aws ubuntu@$(terraform output --raw client_ssh_host):/opt/benchmark/*.json ~/results/
    ```

1. From the root directory of the repository, install the prerequisite packages for the Python script.

    ```bash
    cd ../../bin # openmessaging-benchmark/bin
    python3 -m pip -r install requirements.txt
    ```

1. To list all options, run the script with the `-h` flag.

    ```bash
    ./generate_charts.py -h
    ```

1. To generate charts from your `~/results/` directory, first create an `~/output` directory, then run the script with `--results` and `--output` options set accordingly.

    ```bash
    mkdir ~/output
    ./generate_charts.py --results ~/results --output ~/output
    ```

1. In `~/output`, verify the generated charts are in an HTML page with charts for throughput, publish latency, end-to-end latency, publish rate, and consume rate.


## Tear down benchmark

When done running the benchmark, tear down the Redpanda cluster.

```bash
terraform destroy -auto-approve
```
