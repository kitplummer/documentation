Delete groups from brokers.

Older versions of the Kafka protocol included a retention_millis field in
offset commit requests. Group commits persisted for this retention and then
eventually expired. Once all commits for a group expired, the group would be
considered deleted.

The retention field was removed because it proved problematic for infrequently
committing consumers: the offsets could be expired for a group that was still
active. If clients use new enough versions of OffsetCommit (versions that have
removed the retention field), brokers expire offsets only when the group is
empty for offset.retention.minutes. Redpanda does not currently support that
configuration (see #2904), meaning offsets for empty groups expire only when
they are explicitly deleted.

You may want to delete groups to clean up offsets sooner than when they
automatically are cleaned up, such as when you create temporary groups for
quick investigation or testing. This command helps you do that.

## Usage

```bash
rpk group delete [GROUPS...] [flags]
```
