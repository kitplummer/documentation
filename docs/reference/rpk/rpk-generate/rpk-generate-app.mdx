Generate a sample application to connect with Redpanda.

This command generates a starter application to produce and consume from the
settings defined in the rpk profile. Its goal is to get you producing and
consuming quickly with Redpanda in a language that is familiar to you.

By default, this will run interactively, prompting you to select a language and
a user with which to create your application. To use this without interactivity,
specify how you would like your application to be created using flags.

The `--language` option allows you to specify the language. There is no default.

The `--new-sasl--user` flag allows you to generate a new SASL user
with admin ACLs. If you don't want to use your current profile user or don't want to create a
new one, you can use the `--no-user` flag to generate the starter app without the user.

If you are having trouble connecting to your cluster, you can use the common [`-X admin.hosts=<host:ports>`](../../rpk-x-options#adminhosts) flag to pass a specific Admin API address.


## Examples

- Generate an app with interactive prompts:

    ```
    rpk generate app
    ```

- Generate an app in a specified language with the existing SASL user:

    ```
    rpk generate app --language <lang>
    ```

- Generate an app in the specified language with a new SASL user:

    ```
    rpk generate app -l <lang> --new-sasl-user <user>:<password>
    ```

- Generate an app in the `tmp` directory, but take no action on the user:

    ```
    rpk generate app -l <lang> --no-user --output /tmp
    ```

## Usage

```bash
rpk generate app [flags]
```
