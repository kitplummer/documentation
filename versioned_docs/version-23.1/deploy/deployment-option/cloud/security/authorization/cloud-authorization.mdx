There are two types of authorization in Redpanda Cloud:

- User authorization

  User authorizations, managed by Kafka [ACLs](../../../../../../manage/security/authorization#acls),
  grant users permission to perform specific types of operations on specific
  resources (such as topics, groups, clusters, or transactional IDs).

- Agent authorization

  When deploying an [agent](../../../cloud-overview#agent) as part of BYOC cluster
  provisioning, Redpanda Cloud automatically assigns IAM policies to that agent.
  The IAM policy permissions granted to the agent provide it the authorization
  required to fully manage Redpanda Cloud clusters in AWS or GCP.

  :::important
  IAM policies do not apply or act as deployment permissions, and there are no
  explicit user actions associated with IAM policies. Rather, IAM policy
  permissions apply to Redpanda Cloud agents _only_, and serve to provide Redpanda
  agents access to AWS and GCP clusters so Redpanda brokers can communicate
  with them.
