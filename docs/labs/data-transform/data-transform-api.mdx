## Data Transforms Functions

### OnRecordWritten

```go
func OnRecordWritten(fn OnRecordWrittenCallback)
```

The `OnRecordWritten` function registers a callback of type [`OnRecordWrittenCallback`](#onrecordwrittencallback), which is invoked when a record is written to the input topic.

The function should be called in a package's `main` function to register the transform function that will be applied.

## Data Transforms Types

### OnRecordWrittenCallback

```go
type OnRecordWrittenCallback func(e WriteEvent) ([]Record, error)
```

The `OnRecordWrittenCallback` type is a callback to transform records after a write event happens in the input topic. It's the type of the parameter for the [`OnRecordWritten`](#onrecordwritten) function.

### Record

```go
type Record struct {
	// Key is an optional field.
	Key []byte
	// Value is the blob of data that is written to Redpanda.
	Value []byte
	// Headers are client specified key/value pairs that are
	// attached to a record.
	Headers []RecordHeader
	// Attrs is the attributes of a record.
	//
	// Output records should leave these unset.
	Attrs RecordAttrs
	// The timestamp associated with this record.
	//
	// For output records this can be left unset as it will
	// always be the same value as the input record.
	Timestamp time.Time
	// The offset of this record in the partition.
	//
	// For output records this field is left unset,
	// as it will be set by Redpanda.
	Offset int64
}
```

The `Record` type is a record that has been written to Redpanda.

### RecordAttrs

```go
type RecordAttrs struct {
	// contains filtered or unexported fields
}
```

####  TimestampType

```go
func (a RecordAttrs) TimestampType() int8
```

### RecordHeader

```go
type RecordHeader struct {
	Key   []byte
	Value []byte
}
```

The `RecordHeader` type is an optional key/value pair that is passed along with records.


### WriteEvent

```go
type WriteEvent interface {
	// Access the record associated with this event
	Record() Record
}
```

The `WriteEvent` type contains information about a record that was written.
