#### Chunking remote segments

To support more concurrent consumers of historical data with less local storage, Redpanda can download small chunks of remote segments from the cache directory. For example, when a client fetch request spans a subsection of a 1 GiB segment, instead of downloading the entire 1 GiB segment, Redpanda can download 16 MiB chunks that contain just enough data required to fulfill the fetch request. 

The paths on disk to a chunk are structured as `p_chunks/{chunk_start_offset}`, where `p` is the original path to the segment in the object storage cache. The `_chunks` subdirectory holds chunk files identified by the chunk start offset. These files can be reclaimed by the cache eviction process during the normal eviction path.
 
#### Chunk eviction strategies

A chunk that isn't shared with any data source can be evicted from the cache, so space is returned to disk. Select a chunk eviction strategy with the configuration property `cloud_storage_chunk_eviction_strategy`: 
- `eager`: Evicts chunks that aren't shared with other data sources. Eviction is fast, because no sorting is involved. This is the default.
- `capped`: Evicts chunks until the number of hydrated chunks is below or equal to the maximum hydrated chunks at a time. (This limit is for each segment and calculated using `cloud_storage_hydrated_chunks_per_segment_ratio` by the remote segment.) Eviction is fastest, because no sorting is involved, and the process stops after the cap is reached.
- `predictive`: Uses statistics from readers to determine which chunks to evict. Chunks that aren't in use are sorted by the count of readers that will use the chunk in the future. The counts are populated by readers using the chunk data source. The chunks that are least expensive to re-hydrate are then evicted, taking into account the maximum hydrated chunk count. Eviction is slowest, because chunks are sorted before evicting them.
