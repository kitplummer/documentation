Tiered Storage helps to lower storage costs by offloading log segments to object storage. You can specify the amount of storage you want to retain in local storage. You don't need to specify which log segments you want to move, because Redpanda moves them automatically based on cluster-level configuration properties. Tiered Storage indexes where data is offloaded, so it can look up the data when you need it.

The following image illustrates the Tiered Storage architecture: remote write uploads data from Redpanda to object storage, and remote read fetches data from object storage to Redpanda.

:::important
- When upgrading to Redpanda 23.2, uploads to object storage are paused until all brokers in the cluster are upgraded. If the cluster gets stuck while upgrading, roll it back to the original version. In a mixed-version state, the cluster could run out of disk space. If you need to force a mixed-version cluster to upload, move partition leadership to brokers running the original version. 
- Do not use Tiered Storage with <Link to={props.frontmatter && props.frontmatter.linkRoot + 'labs/data-transform'}>data transforms</Link>, which is a lab feature in technical preview. Lab features are not supported for production usage.
