title: rpk debug bundle
rpk_version: v23.2.1
---

'rpk debug bundle' collects environment data that can help debug and diagnose
issues with a redpanda cluster, a broker, or the machine it's running on. It
then bundles the collected data into a ZIP file, called a diagnostics bundle.

The files and directories in the diagnostics bundle differ depending on the
environment in which Redpanda is running:

COMMON FILES

- Kafka metadata: Broker configs, topic configs, start/committed/end offsets,
  groups, group commits.

- Controller logs: The controller logs directory up to a limit set by
  --controller-logs-size-limit flag

- Data directory structure: A file describing the data directory's contents.

- redpanda configuration: The redpanda configuration file (`redpanda.yaml`;
  SASL credentials are stripped).

- /proc/cpuinfo: CPU information like make, core count, cache, frequency.

- /proc/interrupts: IRQ distribution across CPU cores.

- Resource usage data: CPU usage percentage, free memory available for the
  redpanda process.

- Clock drift: The ntp clock delta (using pool.ntp.org as a reference) & round
  trip time.

- Admin API calls: Cluster and broker configurations, cluster health data, and
  license key information.

- Broker metrics: The broker's Prometheus metrics, fetched through its
  admin API (/metrics and /public_metrics).

BARE-METAL

- Kernel logs: The kernel logs ring buffer (syslog).

- DNS: The DNS info as reported by 'dig', using the hosts in
  /etc/resolv.conf.

- Disk usage: The disk usage for the data directory, as output by 'du'.

- redpanda logs: The node's redpanda logs written to journald. If --logs-since
  or --logs-until are passed, then only the logs within the resulting time frame
  will be included.

- Socket info: The active sockets data output by 'ss'.

- Running process info: As reported by 'top'.

- Virtual memory stats: As reported by 'vmstat'.

- Network config: As reported by 'ip addr'.

- lspci: List the PCI buses and the devices connected to them.

- dmidecode: The DMI table contents. Only included if this command is run
  as root.

KUBERNETES

- Kubernetes Resources: Kubernetes manifests for all resources in the given
  Kubernetes namespace (via --namespace).

- redpanda logs: Logs of each Pod in the the given Kubernetes namespace. If
  --logs-since is passed, only the logs within the given timeframe are
  included.

If you have an upload URL from the Redpanda support team, provide it in the
--upload-url flag to upload your diagnostics bundle to Redpanda.

## Usage

```bash
rpk debug bundle [flags]
