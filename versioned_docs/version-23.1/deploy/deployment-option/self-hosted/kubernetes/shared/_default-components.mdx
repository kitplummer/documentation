By default, the Redpanda Helm chart deploys the following Kubernetes components:

* [A StatefulSet](#statefulset) with three Pods.
* [One PersistentVolumeClaim](#persistentvolumeclaims) for each Pod, each with a capacity of 20Gi.
* [A headless ClusterIP Service and a NodePort Service](#service) for each Kubernetes node that runs a Redpanda broker.
* [Self-Signed TLS Certificates](#tls-certificates). 

### StatefulSet

Redpanda is a stateful application. Each Redpanda broker needs to store its own state (topic partitions) in its own storage volume.
As a result, the Helm chart deploys a StatefulSet to manage the Pods in which the Redpanda brokers are running.

```bash
kubectl get statefulset -n redpanda
```

<details>
<summary>
Example output
</summary>

```
NAME       READY   AGE
redpanda   3/3     3m11s
```

</details>

StatefulSets ensure that the state associated with a particular Pod replica is always the same, no matter how often the Pod is recreated.
Each Pod is also given a unique ordinal number in its name such as `redpanda-0`.
A Pod with a particular ordinal number is always associated with a PersistentVolumeClaim with the same number.
When a Pod in the StatefulSet is deleted and recreated, 
it is given the same ordinal number and so it mounts the same storage volume as the deleted Pod that it replaced.

```bash
kubectl get pod -n redpanda
```

redpanda-2                        1/1     Running     0               6m9s
redpanda-console-5ff45cdb9b-6z2vs 1/1     Running     0               5m
redpanda-configuration-smqv7      0/1     Completed   0               6m9s
```

:::note
The `redpanda-configuration` Job updates the Redpanda runtime configuration.

### PersistentVolumeClaim

Redpanda brokers must be able to store their data on disk.
By default, the Helm chart uses the default StorageClass in the Kubernetes cluster to create a PersistentVolumeClaim for each Pod.
The default StorageClass in your Kubernetes cluster depends on the Kubernetes platform that you are using.

```bash
kubectl get persistentvolumeclaims -n redpanda
```

NAME                 STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   STORAGECLASS   AGE
datadir-redpanda-0   Bound    pvc-3311ade3-de84-4027-80c6-3d8347302962   20Gi       RWO            standard       75s

```

</details>

### Service

The clients writing to or reading from a given partition have to connect directly to the leader broker that hosts the partition. 
As a result, clients needs to be able to connect directly to each Pod.
To allow internal and external clients to connect to each Pod that hosts a Redpanda broker, the Helm chart configures two Services:

- Internal using the [Headless ClusterIP](#headless-clusterip-service)
- External using the [NodePort](#nodeport-service)

```bash
kubectl get service -n redpanda
```

```

</details>

#### Headless ClusterIP Service

The headless Service associated with a StatefulSet gives the Pods their network identity in the form of a fully qualified domain name (FQDN). Both Redpanda brokers in the same Redpanda cluster and clients within the same Kubernetes cluster use this FQDN to communicate with each other.

:::note
An important requirement of distributed applications such as Redpanda is peer discovery:
The ability for each broker to find other brokers in the same cluster.
When each Pod is rolled out, 
its `seed_servers` field is updated with the FQDN of each Pod in the cluster so that they can discover each other.

```bash
kubectl -n redpanda exec redpanda-0 -c redpanda -- cat etc/redpanda/redpanda.yaml
```

```yaml
redpanda:
    data_directory: /var/lib/redpanda/data
    empty_seed_starts_cluster: false
    
    seed_servers:
        - host:
            address: redpanda-0.redpanda.redpanda.svc.cluster.local.
            port: 33145
        - host:
            address: redpanda-1.redpanda.redpanda.svc.cluster.local.
            port: 33145
        - host:
            address: redpanda-2.redpanda.redpanda.svc.cluster.local.
            port: 33145
```
:::

#### NodePort Service

External access is made available by a NodePort service that opens the following ports by default for the listeners:

| Node port | Pod port | Listener |
|---|---|---|
| 30081 | 8081 | Schema Registry |
| 30082 | 8083 | HTTP Proxy |
| 31092 | 9094 | Kafka API |
| 31644 | 9644 | Admin API |

## TLS Certificates

By default, TLS is enabled in the Redpanda Helm chart. 
The Helm chart uses [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) to generate two Certificate resources that provide Redpanda with self-signed certificates:

- The `redpanda-default-cert` Certificate is the TLS certificate that is used by all listeners.
- The `redpanda-default-root-certificate` Certificate is the root certificate authority for the TLS certificates.

```bash
kubectl get certificate -n redpanda
```

```
NAME                                 READY   SECRET                               AGE
redpanda-default-cert                True    redpanda-default-cert                10m
redpanda-default-root-certificate    True    redpanda-default-root-certificate    10m
```
