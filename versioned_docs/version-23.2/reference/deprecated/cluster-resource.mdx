Starting from Redpanda version 23.2, the Cluster and Console custom resources are deprecated and replaced by the new Redpanda custom resource.

The Cluster custom resource was used to configure and deploy Redpanda clusters, while the Console custom resource was used to configure and deploy Redpanda Console.

The new Redpanda custom resource provides declarative configuration for the Redpanda Helm chart, which deploys both Redpanda and Redpanda Console. The latest Redpanda Operator passes configurations defined in the custom resources to Helm, which then deploys the Redpanda cluster according to these specifications.

You should transition from the deprecated Cluster and Console custom resources to the new Redpanda custom resource. Failure to do so might result in compatibility issues with future versions of Redpanda, limited access to new features and enhancements, and potential security vulnerabilities.

To use the new Redpanda resource, you must deploy at least version 23.2 of the Redpanda Operator.

For information about the latest Redpanda Operator and the new Redpanda custom resource, see [Redpanda in Kubernetes](../../../deploy/deployment-option/self-hosted/kubernetes/kubernetes-production-deployment).
