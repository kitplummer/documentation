:::note
Redpanda collects some data from the Kubernetes API.
To communicate with the Kubernetes API, Redpanda requires a ClusterRole attached to the default ServiceAccount for the Pods.
The files and directories that are generated only when the ClusterRole exists are labeled **Requires ClusterRole**.
:::

|File or Directory|Description|
|--|--|
|`/admin`|Cluster and broker configurations, cluster health data, and license key information.<br/>**Requires ClusterRole**.|
| `/controller`|Binary-encoded replicated logs that contain the history of configuration changes as well as internal settings.<br/>Redpanda can replay the events that took place in the cluster to arrive at a similar state.|
|`data-dir.txt`|Metadata for the Redpanda data directory of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed.|
|`du.txt`|The disk usage of the data directory of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed, as output by the `du` command.|
|`/k8s`|Kubernetes manifests for all resources in the given Kubernetes namespace.<br/>**Requires ClusterRole**.|
|`kafka.json`|Kafka metadata, such as broker configuration, topic configuration, offsets, groups, and group commits.|
|`/logs`|Logs of each Pod in the given Kubernetes namespace.<br/>If `--logs-since` is passed, only the logs within the given timeframe are included.<br/>**Requires ClusterRole**.|
|`/metrics`|Prometheus metrics from both the `/metrics` endpoint and the `public_metrics` endpoint.<br/>One directory for each broker's metrics.<br/>**Requires ClusterRole**.|
|`ntp.txt`|The NTP clock delta (using [`ntppool`](https://www.ntppool.org/en/) as a reference) and round trip time of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed.|
|`/proc`|CPU details of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed.<br/>The directory includes a `cpuinfo` file with CPU information such as processor model, core count, cache size, frequency, as well as an `interrupts` file that contains IRQ distribution across CPU cores. |
|`redpanda.yaml`|The Redpanda configuration file of the broker on which the `rpk debug bundle` command was executed.<br/>Sensitive data is removed and replaced with `(REDACTED)`.|
|`resource-usage.json`|Redpanda resource usage data, such as CPU usage and free memory available. |
