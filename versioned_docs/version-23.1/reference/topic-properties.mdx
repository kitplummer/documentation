A topic-level property sets a Redpanda or Kafka configuration for a particular topic. 

Many topic-level properties have corresponding [cluster properties](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/cluster-property-configuration) that set a default value for all topics of a cluster. To customize the value for a topic, you can set a topic-level property that overrides the value of the corresponding cluster property.

| Topic property                                    | Corresponding Cluster property                                                      |

:::note
The `SOURCE` output of the [`rpk topic describe <topic>`](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-describe) command describes how the property is set for the topic:
- `DEFAULT_CONFIG` is set by a Redpanda default.
- `DYNAMIC_TOPIC_CONFIG` is set by the user specifically for the topic and overrides inherited default configurations, such as a default or a cluster-level property.

Although [`rpk topic describe`](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-describe) doesn't report `replication.factor` as a configuration, `replication.factor` can indeed be set by using the [`rpk topic alter-config`](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-alter-config) command.
:::

## Examples

The following examples show how to configure topic-level properties. Set a topic-level property for a topic to override the value of corresponding cluster property.

### Create topic with topic properties

To set topic properties when creating a topic, use the [rpk topic create](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-create) command with the `-c` option.

For example, to create a topic with the `cleanup.policy` property set to `compact`:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic create -c cleanup.policy=compact <topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic create -c cleanup.policy=compact<topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

To configure multiple properties for a topic, use the `-c` option for each property.

For example, to create a topic with all necessary properties for Tiered Storage:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic create -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true <topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic create -c redpanda.remote.recovery=true -c redpanda.remote.write=true -c redpanda.remote.read=true <topic-name>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Modify topic properties

To modify topic properties of an existing topic, use the [rpk topic alter-config](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-alter-config) command.

For example, to modify a topic's `retention.ms` property:

<Tabs groupId="dev-env">
<TabItem value="local" label="Local" default>

```bash
rpk topic alter-config <topic-name> --set retention.ms=<retention-time>
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="k8s" label="Kubernetes">

```bash
kubectl exec <pod-name> -- rpk topic alter-config <topic-name> --set retention.ms=<retention-time>
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Properties

This section describes all supported topic-level properties.

### Disk space properties

Configure properties to manage the disk space used by a topic:

- Clean up log segments by deletion and/or compaction ([`cleanup.policy`](#cleanuppolicy)).
- Retain logs up to a maximum size per partition before cleanup ([`retention.bytes`](#retentionbytes)).
- Retain logs for a maximum duration before cleanup ([`retention.ms`](#retentionms)).
- Periodically close an active log segment ([`segment.ms`](#segmentms)).
- Limit the maximum size of an active log segment ([`segment.bytes`](#segmentbytes)).

---

#### cleanup.policy

The cleanup policy to apply for log segments of a topic.

When `cleanup.policy` is set, it overrides the cluster property [`log_cleanup_policy`](../cluster-properties#log_cleanup_policy) for the topic.

**Default**: `[delete]`

**Values**:

- `[delete]` - Deletes data according to size-based or time-based retention limits, or both.
- `[compact]` - Deletes data according to a key-based retention policy, discarding all but the latest value for each key.
- `[compact,delete]` - The latest values are kept for each key, while the remaining data is deleted according to retention limits.

**Related topics**:

- [Segment size for compacted segments](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#segment-size-for-compacted-segments)
- [Compacted topics in Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage/#compacted-topics-in-tiered-storage)

---

#### retention.bytes

A size-based retention limit that configures the maximum size that a topic partition can grow before becoming eligible for cleanup.

If `retention.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`retention_bytes`](../cluster-properties#retention_bytes) for the topic, and the total retained size for the topic is `retention.bytes` multiplied by the number of partitions for the topic.

When both size-based (`retention.bytes`) and time-based (`retention.ms`) retention limits are set, cleanup occurs when either limit is reached.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

#### retention.ms

A time-based retention limit that configures the maximum duration that a log's segment file for a topic is retained before it becomes eligible to be cleaned up. To consume all data, a consumer of the topic must read from a segment before its `retention.ms` elapses, otherwise the segment may be compacted and/or deleted. If a non-positive value, no per-topic limit is applied.

If `retention.ms` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`delete_retention_ms`](../cluster-properties#delete_retention_ms) for the topic.

When both size-based (`retention.bytes`) and time-based (`retention.ms`) retention limits are set, the earliest occurring limit applies.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)

---

#### segment.ms

The maximum duration that a log segment of a topic is active (open for writes and not deletable). A periodic event, with `segment.ms` as its period, forcibly closes the active segment and transitions, or rolls, to a new active segment. The closed (inactive) segment is then eligible to be cleaned up according to cleanup and retention properties.

If set to a positive duration, `segment.ms` overrides the cluster property [`log_segment_ms`](../cluster-properties#log_segment_ms) and its lower and upper bounds set by [`log_segment_ms_min`](../cluster-properties#log_segment_ms_min) and [`log_segment_ms_max`](../cluster-properties#log_segment_ms_max), respectively.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:
- [Log rolling](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#log-rolling)

---

#### segment.bytes

The maximum size of an active log segment for a topic. When the size of an active segment exceeds `segment.bytes`, the segment is closed and a new active segment is created. The closed, inactive segment is then eligible to be cleaned up according to retention properties.

When `segment.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`log_segment_size`](../tunable-properties#log_segment_size) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Configure segment size](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-segment-size)
- [Configure message retention](../../manage/cluster-maintenance/disk-utilization#configure-message-retention)
- [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)

---

### Message properties

Configure properties for the messages of a topic:

- Compress a message or batch to reduce storage space and increase throughput ([`compression.type`](#compressiontype)).
- Set the source of a message's timestamp ([`message.timestamp.type`](#messagetimestamptype)).
- Set the maximum size of a message ([`max.message.bytes`](#maxmessagebytes)).

#### compression.type

The type of compression algorithm to apply for all messages of a topic. When a compression type is set for a topic, producers compress and send messages, nodes (brokers) store and send compressed messages, and consumers receive and uncompress messages.

Enabling compression reduces message size, which improves throughput and decreases storage for messages with repetitive values and data structures. The trade-off is increased CPU utilization and network latency to perform the compression. You can also enable producer batching to increase compression efficiency, since the messages in a batch likely have repeated data that can be compressed.

When `compression.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [`log_compression_type`](../cluster-properties#log_compression_type) for the topic.

:::note
The valid values of `compression.type` are taken from `log_compression_type` and differ from Kafka's compression types.
:::

**Default**: `none`

**Values**:

- `none`
- `gzip`
- `lz4`
- `snappy`
- `ztsd`
- `producer`

**Related topics**:

- [Message batching](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#message-batching)
- [Common producer configuration options](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#commonly-used-producer-configuration-options)

---

#### message.timestamp.type

The source of a message's timestamp: either the message's creation time or its log append time.

When `message.timestamp.type` is set, it overrides the cluster property [`log_message_timestamp_type`](../cluster-properties#log_message_timestamp_type) for the topic.

**Default**: `CreateTime`

**Values**:

- `CreateTime`
- `LogAppendTime`

---

#### max.message.bytes

The maximum size of a message or batch of a topic. If a compression type is enabled, `max.message.bytes` sets the maximum size of the compressed message or batch.

If `max.message.bytes` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [`kafka_batch_max_bytes`](../tunable-properties#kafka_batch_max_bytes) for the topic.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Message batching](../../develop/produce-data/configure-producers#message-batching)

---

### Tiered Storage properties

Configure properties to manage topics for [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage):

- Upload and fetch data to and from object storage for a topic ([`redpanda.remote.write`](#redpandaremotewrite) and [`redpanda.remote.read`](#redpandaremoteread)).
- Configure size-based and time-based retention properties for local storage of a topic ([`retention.local.target.bytes`](#retentionlocaltargetbytes) and [`retention.local.target.ms`](#retentionlocaltargetms)).
- Recover or reproduce data for a topic from object storage ([`redpanda.remote.recovery`](#redpandaremoterecovery)).
- Delete data from object storage for a topic when it's deleted from local storage ([`redpanda.remote.delete`](#redpandaremotedelete)).

#### redpanda.remote.write

A flag for enabling Redpanda to upload data for a topic from local storage to object storage. When set to `true` together with [redpanda.remote.read](#redpandaremoteread), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.read

A flag for enabling Redpanda to fetch data for a topic from object storage to local storage. When set to `true` together with [redpanda.remote.write](#redpandaremotewrite), it enables the [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage) feature.

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### retention.local.target.bytes

A size-based retention limit for Tiered Storage that configures the maximum size that a topic partition in local storage can grow before becoming eligible for cleanup. It is equivalent to [retention.bytes](#retentionbytes) without Tiered Storage.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### retention.local.target.ms

A time-based retention limit for Tiered Storage that sets the maximum duration that a log's segment file for a topic is retained in local storage before it's eligible for cleanup. This property is equivalent to [retention.ms](#retentionms) without Tiered Storage.

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.recovery

A flag that enables the recovery or reproduction of a topic from object storage for Tiered Storage. The recovered data is saved in local storage, and the maximum amount of recovered data is determined by the local storage retention limits of the topic.

:::tip
You can only configure `redpanda.remote.recovery` when you create a topic. You cannot apply this setting to existing topics.
:::

**Default**: false

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

#### redpanda.remote.delete

A flag that enables deletion of data from object storage for Tiered Storage when it's deleted from local storage for a topic.

:::note
`redpanda.remote.delete` doesn't apply to Remote Read Replica topics: a Remote Read Replica topic isn't deleted from object storage when this flag is `true`.
:::

**Default**:

- `false` for topics created using Redpanda 22.2 or earlier.
- `true` for topics created in Redpanda 22.3 and later, including new topics on upgraded clusters.

**Related topics**:

- [Tiered Storage](../../manage/tiered-storage)

---

### Remote Read Replica properties

Configure properties to manage topics for [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas).

#### redpanda.remote.readreplica

The name of the object storage bucket for a Remote Read Replica topic.

:::caution
Setting `redpanda.remote.readreplica` together with either `redpanda.remote.read` or `redpanda.remote.write` results in an error.
:::

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Remote Read Replicas](../../manage/remote-read-replicas)

---

### Redpanda topic properties

Configure Redpanda-specific topic properties.

#### replication.factor

The number of replicas of a topic to save in different nodes (brokers) of a cluster.

If `replication.factor` is set to a positive value, it overrides the cluster property [default_topic_replications](../cluster-properties#default_topic_replications) for the topic.

:::note
Although `replication.factor` isn't returned or displayed by [`rpk topic describe`](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-describe) as a valid Kafka property, you can set it using [`rpk topic alter-config`](../rpk/rpk-topic/rpk-topic-alter-config). When the `replication.factor` of a topic is altered, it isn't simply a property value that's updated, but rather the actual replica sets of topic partitions that are changed.
:::

**Default**: null

**Related topics**:

- [Choose the replication factor](../../develop/config-topics#choose-the-replication-factor)
- [Change the replication factor](../../develop/config-topics#change-the-replication-factor)
