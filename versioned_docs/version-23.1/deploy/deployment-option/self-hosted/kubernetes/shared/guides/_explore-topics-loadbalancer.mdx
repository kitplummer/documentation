Redpanda Console is a developer-friendly web UI for managing and debugging your Redpanda cluster and your applications.

The community edition of Redpanda Console does not provide authentication, and connects to the Redpanda cluster with superuser rights. Due to this limitation, you should not expose Redpanda Console outside the Kubernetes cluster without a Enterprise Edition.

kubectl -n redpanda port-forward svc/redpanda-console 8080:8080

Then browse to http://localhost:8080


1. Find the external IP address of the Redpanda Console's LoadBalancer Service:

  ```bash
  kubectl get svc redpanda-console -n redpanda
  ```

  <details>
  <summary>
  Example output
  </summary>

  Here, the external IP address is 203.0.113.3, and the port is 8080.

  ```
  NAME                TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP      PORT(S)          AGE
  redpanda-console    LoadBalancer   10.0.251.204   203.0.113.3      8080:30321/TCP   33m
  ```

  </details>

  
1. Open Redpanda Console in a web browser:

  Replace `<external-ip>` with the external IP address of the LoadBalancer Service that's running Redpanda Console.

  ```bash
  http://<external-ip>:8080/brokers
  ```

  All your Redpanda brokers are listed along with their IP addresses and IDs.
