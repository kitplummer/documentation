To create a Dedicated Cloud cluster, log in to Redpanda Cloud, add a namespace, then follow the steps for creating a Dedicated cluster.

## Create a namespace

<CreateNamespace/>

## Create a Dedicated cluster

1. On the Home page, select your namespace (namespaces are listed in alphabetical order), and click **Create cluster**.
2. Click **Create Dedicated cluster**.

   Enter a cluster name, and select the provider (AWS or GCP), region, availability zone type (single AZ or multi AZ) and zones, throughput tier, and Redpanda version. 
   
   :::note notes
   - If you plan to create a private network in your own VPC, select the region where your VPC is located.
   - Three availability zones provide two backups in case one availability zone goes down.
   :::

3. Click **Next**.
   
4. On the Network page, enter the connection type: **Public** or **Private**. 
   
   Private networks require a VPC peering connetion. See [Add a Dedicated VPC Peering Connection](../vpc-peering) to connect your VPC to the Redpanda Cloud VPC.
    
5.  Click **Create**.

    After the cluster is created, you can click the cluster name on the **Home** page to see the overview for it.
