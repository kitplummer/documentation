## Technical preview features

Redpanda continuously adds new features and feature updates. Technical preview features are designed for user testing and feedback in development and testing environments. For example, [Tiered Storage](../manage/tiered-storage) was a lab feature before it was promoted to general availability. Your feedback helps shape the future of Redpanda.
