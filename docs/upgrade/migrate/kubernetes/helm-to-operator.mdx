If you are using the Redpanda Helm chart, you can migrate to the Redpanda Operator and use it to manage your Helm deployment.

The Redpanda Operator extends Kubernetes with custom resource definitions (CRDs), which allow Redpanda clusters to be treated as native Kubernetes resources. The primary resource that the Redpanda Operator uses to represent a Redpanda cluster is the Redpanda resource.

When you define a Redpanda cluster using this Redpanda resource, the Redpanda Operator takes that configuration and passes it to [Flux](https://fluxcd.io/flux/concepts/). Flux, in turn, interacts with Helm, creating the necessary HelmRepository and HelmRelease resources to deploy and manage the Redpanda Helm chart.

Here is an example of a Redpanda custom resource:

```yaml
apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
kind: Redpanda
metadata:
  name: <cluster-name>
spec:
  chartRef:
    helmRepositoryName:
  clusterSpec:
```

- `metadata.name`: Name to assign the Redpanda cluster.
- [`spec.chartRef`](../../../../reference/crd#chartref): Information about the Helm chart that will be used to deploy Redpanda.
- [`spec.chartRef.helmRepositoryName`](../../../../reference/crd#helmrepositoryname): Name of the Helm repository where the Redpanda chart is located.
- [`spec.clusterSpec`](../../../../reference/crd#redpandaclusterspec): This is where you can override default values in the Redpanda Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

Before migrating to the Redpanda Operator, you must have:

- The name of your existing Helm release and the latest version of the Redpanda Helm chart that you have deployed.

  ```bash
  helm list -A
  ```

  In this example the chart version is 5.0.1 and the release name is `redpanda`.

  ```nocopy
  NAME       CHART
  redpanda   redpanda-5.0.1
  ```

  Make a note of your name and version for the next steps. You'll need to configure your Redpanda custom resource with these details.

- Your values overrides.

  ```bash
  helm get values <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

  You should see your overrides in YAML format. You'll need to configure your Redpanda custom resource with these details.

:::tip
Before implementing any changes in your production environment, Redpanda Data recommends testing the migration in a non-production environment.

## Migrate to the Redpanda Operator and Helm

To migrate to the latest Redpanda Operator and use it to manage your Helm deployment, follow these steps.

1. Make sure that you have permission to install custom resource definitions (CRDs):

  ```bash
  kubectl auth can-i create CustomResourceDefinition --all-namespaces
  ```

  You should see `yes` in the output.

  You need cluster-level permissions to install the Redpanda Operator CRDs in the next steps.

1. Install the Redpanda Operator custom resource definitions (CRDs):

  ```bash
  kubectl kustomize https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda//src/go/k8s/config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

1. Install the Redpanda Operator *in the same namespace as your Redpanda Helm chart*:

  ```bash
  helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com
  helm upgrade --install redpanda-controller redpanda/operator \
    --namespace <namespace> \
    --set image.repository=docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda-operator \
    --set image.tag=v23.2.4 \
    --create-namespace
  ```

1. Ensure that the Deployment is successfully rolled out:

  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> rollout status -w deployment/redpanda-controller-operator
  ```

  ```text-nocopy
  deployment "redpanda-controller" successfully rolled out
  ```

1. Configure a Redpanda custom resource that Redpanda Operator will use to adopt your Redpanda cluster.

  Replace the placeholders with the values identified in the [prerequisites](#prerequisites).

  ```yaml title="redpanda-cluster.yaml"
  apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Redpanda
  metadata:
    annotations:
      cluster.redpanda.com/managed: "true"
    creationTimestamp: null
    name: <cluster-name>
  spec:
    chartRef:
      chartVersion: <chart-version>
    clusterSpec:
      <chart-overrides>
  ```

  :::note
  By selecting the correct chart version, you ensure control over your deployment. If you don't select a chart version, the operator may upgrade your chart, potentially causing unintended downtime.
  :::

  :::tip
  The Redpanda Operator passes these values to the Redpanda Helm chart. The keys in the `clusterSpec` field are the same as those in the Redpanda Helm chart. For details on the structure and configuration options of the Redpanda custom resource, refer to the [Redpanda Operator CRD reference](../../../../reference/crd#redpandaclusterspec).
  :::

1. Adopt the Redpanda cluster by creating an instance of the Redpanda custom resource in the same namespace as the Redpanda Operator:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f redpanda-cluster.yaml --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Wait for the Redpanda resource to successfully reach a `deployed` state:

  ```bash
  kubectl get redpanda --namespace <namespace> --watch
  ```

  Example output:

  ```nocopy
  NAME       READY   STATUS
  redpanda   True    Redpanda reconciliation succeeded
  ```

## Troubleshooting

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue.

### HelmRelease is not ready

If you are using the Redpanda Operator with Helm, you may see the following message while waiting for a Redpanda custom resource to be deployed:

```bash-nocopy
NAME       READY   STATUS
redpanda   False   HelmRepository 'redpanda/redpanda-repository' is not ready
redpanda   False   HelmRelease 'redpanda/redpanda' is not ready
```

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue. Follow the steps below to investigate:

1. Check the status of the HelmRelease:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe helmrelease redpanda --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Review the Redpanda Operator logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redpanda-operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
  ```

Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace in which you deployed the Redpanda Operator.

### HelmRelease retries exhausted


The `HelmRelease retries exhausted` error occurs when the Helm Controller has tried to reconcile the HelmRelease a number of times, but these attempts have failed consistently.

The Helm Controller watches for changes in HelmRelease objects. Once changes are detected, it tries to reconcile the state defined in the HelmRelease with the actual state in the cluster. The process of reconciliation includes installation, upgrade, testing, rollback or uninstallation of Helm releases.

You may see this error due to:

- Incorrect configuration in the HelmRelease.
- Issues with the chart, such as a non-existent chart version or the chart repository not being accessible.
- Missing dependencies or prerequisites required by the chart.
- Issues with the underlying Kubernetes cluster, such as insufficient resources or connectivity issues.

To debug this error do the following:

1. Check the status of the HelmRelease:

  ```bash
  kubectl describe helmrelease <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Review the Redpanda Operator logs:

  ```bash
  kubectl logs -l app.kubernetes.io/name=redpanda-operator -c manager --namespace <namespace>
  ```

When you find and fix the error, you must use the Flux CLI, `fluxctl`, to suspend and resume the reconciliation process:

1. [Install Flux CLI](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/#install-the-flux-cli).

1. Suspend the HelmRelease:

  ```bash
  flux suspend helmrelease <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Resume the HelmRelease:

  ```bash
  flux resume helmrelease <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

### Open an issue

If you cannot solve the issue or you need assistance during the migration process, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/new/choose) in the Redpanda repository. Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues on GitHub to see if someone has already reported a similar problem or if any relevant discussions that can help you.

## Rollback from Redpanda Operator to Helm

If you migrated to the Redpanda Operator and want to revert to using only Helm, follow these steps:

1. Uninstall or disable the Redpanda Operator.

  You can unnstall the Redpanda Operator using Helm or disable it by changing the image to one that does not exist:

  ```bash
  kubectl edit pod <operator-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Remove the [finalizers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/finalizers/) from the Redpanda, HelmRelease, HelmChart, and HelmRepository resources:

  ```bash
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> patch redpanda <cluster-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> patch helmrelease <cluster-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> patch helmchart <cluster-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
  kubectl --namespace <namespace> patch helmrepository <cluster-name> -p '{"metadata":{"finalizers":null}}' --type=merge
  ```

1. Delete the resources:

  ```bash
  kubectl delete redpanda <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  kubectl delete helmrelease <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  kubectl delete helmchart <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  kubectl delete helmrepository <cluster-name> --namespace <namespace>
  ```

After completing these steps, the Redpanda Operator is no longer managing your Helm deployment.
