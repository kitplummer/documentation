:::caution
Redpanda Operator is in beta. Do not migrate existing production clusters to the Redpanda Operator.
:::

If you are using the Redpanda Helm chart, you can migrate to the Redpanda Operator and use it to manage your Helm deployment.

The Redpanda Operator complements the Redpanda Helm chart by extending Kubernetes with custom resource definitions (CRDs). These CRDs allow Redpanda clusters to be represented as native Kubernetes resources. This abstraction makes it simpler to manage the lifecycle of Redpanda deployments, as the Redpanda Operator takes the specifications declared in the CRDs and passes them to Helm for execution.

When using the Redpanda Operator, configurations defined in the custom resources are passed to Helm, which then deploys the Redpanda cluster using the Redpanda Helm chart.

## Prerequisites

The Redpanda Helm chart must be deployed in your Kubernetes cluster.

## Migrate to the Redpanda Operator and Helm

To migrate to the latest Redpanda Operator and use it to manage your Helm deployment, follow these steps.

1. Install the Redpanda Operator custom resource definitions (CRDs):

  ```bash
  kubectl kustomize https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda//src/go/k8s/config/crd | kubectl apply -f -
  ```

1. Install the Redpanda Operator in the same namespace as your Redpanda Helm chart:

  ```bash
  helm repo add redpanda https://charts.redpanda.com
  helm upgrade --install redpanda-controller redpanda/redpanda-operator \
    --namespace <namespace> \
    --set image.repository=docker.redpanda.com/redpandadata/redpanda-operator \
    --set image.tag=v23.2.1 \
    --create-namespace
  ```

1. Migrate your existing Redpanda Helm chart configuration to the Redpanda custom resource.

  Configure all your custom overrides in the `clusterSpec` field. The Redpanda Operator passes these values to the Redpanda Helm chart. The keys in the `clusterSpec` field are the same as in the values file of the Redpanda Helm chart.

  ```yaml title="redpanda-cluster.yaml"
  apiVersion: cluster.redpanda.com/v1alpha1
  kind: Redpanda
  metadata:
    name: <name>
  spec:
    clusterSpec:
  ```

  :::tip
  For details on the structure and configuration options of the Redpanda custom resource, refer to the [Redpanda Operator CRD reference](../../../../reference/crd#redpandaclusterspec).
  :::

1. Deploy the Redpanda cluster by creating an instance of the Redpanda custom resource in the same namespace as the Redpanda Operator:

  ```bash
  kubectl apply -f redpanda-cluster.yaml --namespace <namespace>
  ```

1. Wait for the Redpanda resource to be successfully deployed:

  ```bash
  kubectl get redpanda --namespace <namespace> --watch
  ```

## Troubleshooting

While the deployment process can sometimes take a few minutes, a prolonged 'not ready' status may indicate an issue. See [Troubleshoot Redpanda in Kubernetes](../../../../manage/kubernetes/troubleshooting/troubleshoot#helmrelease-is-not-ready) for more details.

If you cannot solve the issue or you need assistance during the migration process, [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/redpanda-data/redpanda/issues/new/choose) in the Redpanda repository. Before opening a new issue, search the existing issues on GitHub to see if someone has already reported a similar problem or if any relevant discussions that can help you.

## Next steps
