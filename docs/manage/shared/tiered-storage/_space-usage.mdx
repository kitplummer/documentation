Use [`rpk cluster logdirs describe`](../../../reference/rpk/rpk-cluster/rpk-cluster-logdirs-describe/) to get details about Tiered Storage space usage. The directories for object storage start with `remote://<bucket_name>`. For example:

```bash
rpk cluster logdirs describe

BROKER  DIR                              TOPIC               PARTITION  SIZE      ERROR

```

#### Integration with space utilization tools

Third-party tools that query space utilization from the Redpanda cluster might not handle `remote://` entries properly. Redpanda space usage is reported from each broker, but object storage is shared between brokers. Third-party tools could over-count storage and show unexpectedly high disk usage for Tiered Storage topics. In this situation, you can disable output of `remote://` entries by setting `kafka_enable_describe_log_dirs_remote_storage` to `false`.
