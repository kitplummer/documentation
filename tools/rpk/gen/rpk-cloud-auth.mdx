Manage rpk cloud authentications.

An rpk cloud authentication allows you to talk to Redpanda Cloud. Most likely,
you will only ever need to use a single SSO based login and you will not need
this command space. Multiple authentications can be useful if you have multiple
Redpanda Cloud accounts for different organizations and want to swap between
them, or if you use SSO as well as client credentials. It is recommended to
only use a single SSO based login.

## Usage

```bash
rpk cloud auth [flags]
  rpk cloud auth [command]
```
