Generate Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics.

Use this command to generate sample Grafana dashboards for Redpanda metrics. 
These dashboards can be imported into a Grafana or Grafana Cloud instance.

To select a specific dashboard, use the `--dashboard` flag followed by the 
dashboard name. For example, to generate the operations dashboard, run:

```
rpk generate grafana-dashboard --dashboard operations
```

The selected dashboard will be downloaded from Redpanda Data's [observability GitHub repository](https://github.com/redpanda-data/observability).

:::note
The legacy dashboard is still available as an option (`legacy`), but it isn't downloaded from GitHub. Instead, the generated dashboard is based on which metrics endpoint is used (`--metrics-endpoint`).

### Available dashboards

You can select one of the following dashboard types:

<table>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <strong>Name</strong>
      </td>
      <td>
        <strong>Description</strong>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>consumer-metrics</td>
      <td>
        Allows for monitoring of Java Kafka consumers, using the 
        Prometheus JMX Exporter and the Kafka Sample 
        Configuration. 
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>consumer-offsets</td>
      <td>
        Metrics and KPIs that provide details of topic consumers 
        and how far they are lagging behind the end of the log.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>operations [default]</td>
      <td>
        Provides an overview of KPIs for a Redpanda cluster with 
        health indicators. This is suitable for ops or SRE to 
        monitor on a daily or continuous basis.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>topic-metrics</td>
      <td>

        of each/all topics.
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>legacy</td>
      <td>
        Generates dashboard based on selected metrics endpoint 
        (--metrics-endpoint). Modify prometheus datasource and
