Redpanda recommends that you configure encryption, authentication, and authorization for production environments.

- [Configure TLS on Kubernetes](../security/kubernetes-tls)

  Use TLS to authenticate Redpanda brokers and encrypt communication between clients and brokers.

- [Configure SASL on Kubernetes](../security/sasl-kubernetes)

  Simple Authentication and Security Layer (SASL) provides authentication between the Redpanda brokers and clients.
